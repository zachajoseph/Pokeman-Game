Goals and Resources for Zach Joseph for week 8

During this week, My goals for this week were:

1- Learn the object oriented programming require to create pokemon classes and use the template to create my own for battles
2- Reseach and utilize GUI interfaces to figure out the display for the Pokemon Game
3- Learn how to make the Game an open world interface( Stretch Goal )

I was able to complete my first goal as listed in the repl above utilizing the template and ideas shown in this video
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbs6jQZrZA4
 and added 6 new pokemon to the list of potential encounters and randomized the pokemon you can fight. These changes can be seen in the repo above.
  
Then I started researching different gui types that were compatible with repl.it and I found some examples that I may or may not use.
The different libraries I am researching and evaluating are:
-REMI
-TKTinker
-PYgame

Here are Repl examples I have forked and played around with:
